# Predictive Analysis of project launches on Kickstarter

Abstract:

The question we have tried to answer, and on which our project is based, is the following: is it possible, on the basis of the data at our disposal, to predict the outcome of a project campaign, in particular as success or failure?
Kickstarter allows a project to materialise thanks to the support of a community of investors. Once the funding target ceiling has been reached, the campaign is successful, thus making it classifiable with "success" attribute. Starting with the attributes available to us, we reasoned about the information we would have before launching a project.
Using the attributes best suited to our problem and creating new attributes from the initial ones, we used various classifiers to predict the outcome of a project campaign. We thus came up with the most optimal model for identifying the possible outcomes of a campaign, starting from information known only at the launch of the campaign itself. Our predictive analysis could be very useful for those who decide to launch a project on Kickstarter and would like to understand under which conditions the project is most likely to succeed, which is the primary goal of a crowdfunding campaign.
